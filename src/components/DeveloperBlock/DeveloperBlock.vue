          Look at any PR (pull request) in a full coding environment where you
          can edit, build, and test the PR code, by just prepending "gitpod.io#"
          to the PR URL. Super useful for reviewing/testing stuff without having
          to check it out locally!

          I think I’m in love with @gitpod. It’s such a powerful tool. I’ve
          learned so much in the past week just from stumbling across Github
          repos that interest me and appending “http://gitpod.io/#” to the URL.
          A+ tool all around.
